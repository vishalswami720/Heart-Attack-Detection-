Overwive Of Project:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have become one of the most significant health challenges worldwide, contributing to millions of deaths each year. These diseases often develop silently over time due to lifestyle factors like poor diet, lack of xercise, smoking, and genetics. By the time symptoms become apparent, the damage may already be irreversible. Therefore, timely tection and prevention play a critical role in mitigating the effects of cardiovascular diseases. With the advancement of technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a huge opportunity to revolutionize the way we detect and manage cardiovascular health. This project combines Machine Learning (ML), hardware monitoring devices, and realtime alerts to create a proactive system for the prediction, prevention, and early detection of cardiovascular diseases. The system continuously monitors vital health parameters, such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels, using various sensors, and applies a trained AI model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Based on these predictions, immediate preventive actions, such as calling emergency services or notifying a healthcare provider, can be triggered automatically.
